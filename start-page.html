			<div class="about">
				<p>With the development of technology, society increasingly spends time on various entertainment websites, social networks, news portals, and so on. When a person browses, for example, a news feed on a social network, they simply scan the content: saw, scrolled, forgot, saw again, scrolled, and immediately forgot. This process involves short-term memory. People quickly switch from one topic to another. Neuroscientists have repeatedly concluded that the average modern person is generally more inattentive than, say, a half of century ago. Of course, both short-term and long-term memory are equally important. But without usage of long-term memory, the human brain becomes more forgetful and unfocused.</p>
				<p>Therefore, planning things becomes more difficult. It also becomes harder to follow the flow of events that are happening around them and not miss anything. To help us organize our time, planners, organizers, and many other tools, including event calendars, was invented.</p>

				<div class="features">
